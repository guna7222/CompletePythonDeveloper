# Variables
"""
Programs are simply data being stored, being changed, and removed that's all programs
all.

Assigning a value to the variable is also called binding.
"""

# Variables are containers for storing data types.

"""
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
